## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. PocketBase handles user authentication with email/password
2. Auth state is managed through PocketBase auth store
3. User data is synced with Redux for component access
4. Auth state persistence is handled by PocketBase automatically

### File Upload Strategy

1. Media files are uploaded directly to PocketBase
2. File URLs are generated using PocketBase file API
3. Images are processed and converted to Blobs before upload
4. Profile pictures and post media use the same upload mechanism

### Data Relationships

- PocketBase relations replace Firebase document references
- Expand functionality is used to fetch related data
- Collection queries use PocketBase filter syntax
- Real-time updates can be implemented with PocketBase subscriptions

### Error Handling

- All services include try-catch blocks
- Errors are logged and re-thrown for component handling
- Type-safe error handling with TypeScript

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

Before deploying to production, the following should be tested:
